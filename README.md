# Goal: View NightScout BG Readings on Fitbit Ionic

## Plan
- Show API call on watch face
- Format information for Ionic watch face
- Allow settings within app to specify NightScout endpoint per patient
- Test with other diabetics using FitbitIonic watches or ask for other NightScout end points to test
- Publish app through FitBit app store (determine any additional requirements needed to publish, other than a working application)

*Because the Fitbit SDK tools are focused on local development this code will only be periodically updated as progress is made.*

### Based on the Fitbit example for the Bay Area Rapid Transit (BART)

Fitbit SDK example application which downloads real-time BART data and show
upcoming trains for a station of your choice.
