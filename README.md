# Goal: View NightScout BG Readings on Fitbit Ionic

### Plan **IN PROGRESS**
**Phase 1**
- Show API call on watch face
- Format information for Ionic watch face
- Allow settings within app to specify NightScout endpoint per patient
- Test with other diabetics using FitbitIonic watches or ask for other NightScout end points to test
- Publish app through FitBit app store (determine any additional requirements needed to publish, other than a working application)

**Phase 2**
- Use learnings from app development to develop a watch face that displays your current blood glucose reading

**Phase 3**
- Using urchin model add functionality for customizations and OpenAPS data

*Because the Fitbit SDK tools are focused on local development this code will only be periodically updated as progress is made.*

Based on the Fitbit SDK example application which downloads real-time BART data and show
upcoming trains for a station of your choice.
